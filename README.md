# patterns_in_java
Welcome to the **patterns\_in\_java** repository! 👋

This project is a collection of **pattern printing programs** written in **Java**. These are useful for students, beginners, and anyone preparing for technical interviews. Each file focuses on a different category of patterns that are commonly asked in programming exercises and coding rounds.

## 📂 Current Content

* **Triangular Patterns**:
  The first set of uploaded programs includes **triangular patterns** using loops in Java. These patterns demonstrate how to use nested loops and conditional logic to print various triangle shapes (e.g., right-angled, inverted, pyramid, etc.).

## 🛠️ What's Coming Next

I plan to add various other pattern types in the future, including:

* Square and rectangular patterns
* Diamond patterns
* Number-based patterns
* Character/alphabet patterns
* Advanced and creative patterns

Stay tuned for more updates!
